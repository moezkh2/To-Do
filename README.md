## Description

To-Do is a task management app to help you stay organized and manage your daily tasks. To-Do stores your tasks in local storage, meaning when you refresh or close the page they won't disappear. The app gives the possibility of marking the tasks as done if you achieved that task. If you created a lot of tasks, you can filter them by state (task done or not).
